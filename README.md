Element Merge Game
Welcome to Element Merge, a simple yet challenging puzzle game where you combine elements to create new ones and aim to reach the highest tier possible. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
https://sencerbilim.github.io/Element-merge/



Element Merge is inspired by the classic 2048 game but with a twist. Instead of numbers, you merge basic elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Air) to create new elements, progressively unlocking higher-tier elements as you play. The objective is to keep merging and achieve the highest element possible.

Features
Merge Elements: Combine elements like Water, Fire, Earth, and Air to create new ones.
Animated Gameplay: Smooth animations for merging tiles and spawning new ones.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Background Music & Sound Effects: Immerse yourself in the gameplay with background music and satisfying sound effects.
Splash Screen: A welcoming splash screen with a Play button to start the game.
Game Over Screen: Displays a game-over message when no more moves are possible.
How to Play
Start the Game: Click the Play button on the splash screen to start the game.
Merge Elements: Use the arrow keys (or swipe on mobile) to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same element touch, they merge to form a new element.
Continue Playing: Keep merging elements to create new ones and aim to reach the highest tier.
Game Over: The game ends when no more moves are possible. You can then choose to play again.
